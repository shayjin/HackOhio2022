## HACKOH/O 2022 @ The Ohio State University
- Challenge: Build an energy dashboard to be displayed on a lobby screen for different types of buildings using ENGIEâ€™s energy data.
- Collaborated with @EllaLee
- All meter data pulls are hourly intervals from Jan 1, 2017 to present for buildings for natural gas, electricity, chilled water, heating hot water, steam, and total EUI (all available utilities summed together) in KBTU.
- If there are 0s for a given utility, that means there either is no meter installed at that time or no usage for that type of utility for a buildings (for example, not all buildings have chilled water meters because they do not use it, or a building may not have had a meter installed in 2017 and comes online much later). Occupancy data is measured by number of device connections to the wifi network.

- Figma for UI, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for Frontend
